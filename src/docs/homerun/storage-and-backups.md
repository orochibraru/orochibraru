# Storage & backups

## Storage volumes

A **storage volume** (`/storage`) is a named source you define once, then mount
into one or more services from each service's Volumes tab:

- **Bind mount**, an absolute path on the host filesystem.
- **Docker-managed volume**, a named Docker volume, created/managed by Docker
  itself.

Docker's own bind-vs-named-volume syntax is what tells the two apart under the
hood; you just pick a kind and a source when creating one. A volume becomes
"shared" simply by being mounted into more than one service, there's no separate
"shared volume" concept to configure.

`/storage` has a search box, Kind and Backups filters, a list/card view toggle,
and a pager once you have more than a page's worth, same toolkit as the
[services list](services.md#the-services-list), searched/paginated server-side
the same way.

## S3-compatible backups

Configured per-volume on `storage/[volumeId]`, off by default. Homerun tars the
volume's contents and uploads it as `<prefix/>volumeName-<timestamp>.tar.gz` to
any S3-compatible endpoint, AWS S3, MinIO, R2, Backblaze B2, etc., via a
hand-rolled Signature V4 client (path-style addressing, single-request PUT, no
multipart).

**Both volume kinds are backed up.** A bind mount's contents are tarred straight
off the host filesystem. A Docker-managed volume's contents aren't visible
there, so Homerun mounts it read-only into a short-lived `alpine` helper
container that tars it to stdout instead, that container is removed as soon as
it exits, and a failure to read the volume fails the run with the helper's own
stderr attached.

Set a cron schedule alongside the S3 destination to back up automatically; the
scheduler mirrors the [scheduled-redeploy](services.md#scheduled-redeploy) shape
(a 60-second tick, a due-check, a guard against double-firing in the same
minute).

Backups, scheduled or from a "Run now" button, are queued and run in the
background (see [the job queue](services.md#the-job-queue)), so the button
returns straight away and the run shows up in the history on `/backups` once it
starts. A failed backup is retried once. `/backups` itself has a search box
(matches volume name), an Outcome filter (success/failed/running), and a pager
over that history, so a long-running instance with hundreds of past runs can
still page all the way back through them instead of only ever seeing the newest
handful.

**There's no restore flow yet**, uploads only. Retrieve a backup from your S3
destination directly (`aws s3 cp`, `rclone`, your provider's console) and unpack
it into the bind-mount path (or into a named volume, through a helper container
of your own) by hand.
