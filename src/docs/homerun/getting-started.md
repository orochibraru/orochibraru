# Getting started

Homerun needs three things at runtime: a Docker socket to manage containers, a
Postgres database, and Traefik for routing/TLS. Pick whichever install path
fits.

Both options below run entirely from prebuilt release binaries and Docker
images, neither needs Bun, `git`, or a source checkout on the target host. Want
to run this from source instead (to develop on it)? See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Option A, the one-liner (fresh Linux server)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orochibraru/homerun/main/packages/installer/bootstrap.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --mode=full
```

This downloads the prebuilt `homerun-installer-<arch>` release binary for your
host's architecture and runs it, which:

1. Installs Docker Engine plus the host prerequisites for **rootless** Docker.
2. Creates a dedicated system user (`homerun` by default) and installs rootless
   Docker under that account, nothing this app deploys runs as root.
3. Creates the `homerun` Docker network.
4. Asks what domain (or IP) this instance will be reached at, offering the
   host's own address as the default. It is never `localhost`: that address
   becomes the app's `ORIGIN`, and better-auth only trusts that one origin, so a
   `localhost` value makes the first sign-up fail with "Invalid origin" from any
   browser that isn't on the box. Pass `--domain=homerun.example.com` to answer
   it up front, which a `curl | bash` install has to do (no terminal to prompt
   on, so it takes the detected address otherwise).
5. Writes a standalone compose file and runs `docker compose up -d` against it
   under that rootless daemon: Traefik, Postgres, and the app itself, all pulled
   from published images, then prints the dashboard URL.

Run `--mode=agent` instead of `--mode=full` if you only want this box to run the
[Homerun Agent](remote-hosts-and-agent.md#homerun-agent) as a remote build
server for a different Homerun instance, not the full app. Add `--dry-run` to
print every command without running anything, `--version=vX.Y.Z` to pin a
release instead of the latest one, and see
[`packages/installer/README.md`](../packages/installer/README.md) for the rest
of the flags (`--user=`, `--port=`).

> The installer's mutating steps (package install, rootless Docker setup,
> systemd units) are verified live for both `--mode=agent` and `--mode=full`
> against real disposable VMs, see
> [`packages/installer/README.md`](../packages/installer/README.md) for what was
> checked (and the real bugs that run found and fixed). `--dry-run` first is
> still a good habit on a box that matters, and
> `packages/installer/swarm-join.sh` specifically hasn't had the same
> real-hardware pass yet.

## Option B, Docker Compose

Already have Docker set up the way you want it (rootful is fine here) and just
want the stack? [`compose.prod.yaml`](../compose.prod.yaml) runs Traefik +
Postgres + the app itself, all pulled from published images, no installer, no
rootless setup, no source checkout:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orochibraru/homerun/main/compose.prod.yaml
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orochibraru/homerun/main/.env.example
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orochibraru/homerun/main/homerun.example.yaml -o homerun.yaml
mv .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env   # set AUTH_SECRET at minimum, see configuration.md
docker network create homerun
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

`compose.prod.yaml` is self-contained (it doesn't `extends:` the in-repo
`tools/compose/*.yaml` fragments `compose.yaml` shares, so a downloaded copy
works on its own) and bind-mounts the `homerun.yaml` above into the app
container, hence the third download, see
[Configuration](configuration.md#compose-only-variables). `AUTH_SECRET` and
`ORIGIN` are the two values with no default and `docker compose` refuses to
start without them: `ORIGIN` is the scheme+host you actually open the dashboard
at, port included (`http://203.0.113.10:3000`, `https://homerun.example.com`).
Leaving it at `localhost` when you reach the instance at anything else makes
sign-in and the first sign-up fail with "Invalid origin".

[`compose.yaml`](../compose.yaml) (the dev-only variant, no `app` service) is
the reference if you'd rather run each container by hand.

## First boot

Visit the app (`http://localhost:5173` in dev, otherwise the address the
installer printed / the `ORIGIN` you set). The first account you create becomes
**admin** automatically, every account after that is created by an admin from
`/users` (direct-create or email invite), there's no public sign-up.

Signing in for the first time on a fresh instance drops you into a 5-step
onboarding wizard (Core / Docker / Traefik / Email / Review) that sets the
instance-wide config a first deploy needs: base domain, Docker socket/network,
Traefik entrypoint/cert resolver, and (optionally) SMTP for invite emails.
Everything it sets is also editable later from `/settings`, see
[Configuration](configuration.md).

## Health check

`GET /api/health` returns a plain `200 OK`, useful for a container healthcheck
or an uptime monitor, and unauthenticated by design (matches
`/api/v1/openapi.json`'s "spec/health describe shape, not data" carve-out, see
[API & CLI](api-and-cli.md)).

## Next steps

- [Configuration](configuration.md), the full environment variable reference.
- [Services](services.md), deploy your first service.
